    <h3> What is this? </h3>
        
    <p> This is a project from Web Tech class. My current plan is to make it a history of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"> Bangladesh</a>, where I am from. I am starting with this idea but as I go along with this project, I might make some changes accordingly. </p>

    <h3> Why?</h3>

    <p> While working on the history of Bangladesh, I will get the exposure of the history and will get the opportunity to learn more about other countries. There are different opinion on third-war countries. I wanted to make people aware of those countries and the posable ways to help those countries. </p>

    <h3>For Who?</h3>
    <p> It is for anyone who is looking to learn more about other countries. My goal is to make the Bangladeshi American community more aware of our background. As a Bangladeshi American, it is hard to connect back to the country I was born in. </p>

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>The content of this project is still in the process of being created. I want to address the independence of Bangladesh. I want to mentions the ruler of Bangladesh, the culture, and community. As I have mentioned before, I don't have as much knowledge about Bangladesh, I will learn along the way.</p>
