          <td>1947 Partition of British India</td>
          <td>
            In 1947, partition gave way to two new states. These were India,
            with a Hindu majority population and Pakistan, with a Muslim
            majority population. Pakistan is comprised of two distinct areas,
            separated both culturally, and geographically. India filled the
            thousand miles of land between these two regions. Political power
            was concentrated in West Pakistan, which led to grievances in East
            Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

          <td>1947 – 1971 Pakistan period - Bengali language movement</td>
          <td>
            In 1948, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's Governor-General, declared
            that "Urdu, and only Urdu" would be Pakistan's state language. This
            decision was unacceptable to Bengalis and led to birth of the
            language movement. Urdu was hardly spoken by anybody in the East.
            The decision led to protests. On 20 February 1952, the Pakistani
            Government issued Section 144, restricting gatherings and rallies.

        <tr>
          <td>21 February 1952 – Martyrs’ Day</td>
          <td>
            On 21 February, Bengali students gathered, defying Section 144. The
            police opened fire, killing four students, one other person and
            injuring many. The language movement led to the realisation that the
            Bengalis constituted a separate nation. Their destiny lay not with
            Pakistan but elsewhere as an independent country.

          <td>7 March 1971 speech</td>
          <td>
            On 7 March 1971, as the military and the West's political leadership
            was conspiring not to hand over power to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
            Rahman, he delivered a fiery speech at the Racecourse Ground against
            the ruling elite. He urged ‘his people’ to turn every house into a
            fort of resistance. He closed his speech by saying, "Our struggle is
            for our freedom; our struggle is for our independence. Joi Bangla!"
            This powerful speech inspired the Bengali nation to fight for its
            independence. In 2016 the speech was recognised by UNESCO and
            archived in its Memory of the World Programme. In Tower Hamlets, a
            school in Bethnal Green, Bangabandhu Primary, is named in his
            honour. The ‘7 March Foundation’ was set up in 2018 to propagate
            Bangabandhu’s ideals. This year Bangladesh is also observing
            Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 100 birth anniversary.

            26 March 1971 – 16 December 1971, The Liberation War of Bangladesh
          </td>
          <td>
            There were spontaneous uprisings throughout Bangladesh following the
            declaration of independence on 26 March 1971. On 12 April 1971,
            Colonel MAG Osmani was appointed Commander-in-chief of Bangladesh
            Forces known as the Mukti Bahini. In addition to Mukti Bahini,
            guerrilla groups led by individual leaders successfully controlled
            some areas within Bangladesh.

            On 21 November 1971, Bangladesh Muktu Bahini and the Indian forces
            formed an Allied Command and went on to defeat the West Pakistani
            army. The resulting surrender was the largest in the number of
            prisoners of war since World War II. Victory against Pakistan was
            declared on 16 December 1971.
